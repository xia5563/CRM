CRM project


Hi there, this is the repository for CRM project using Code Igniter (MVC framework).  

Mostly, three folders are important: 
"controllers" contains most business logics, 
"models" for manipulating database, 
"views" for the Front end part. (The view files should be with extention ".php" instead of ".html").
